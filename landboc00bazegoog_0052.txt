1250 The Lady Chapel was built in the Cemetery.
13⁷3. The Abbey was fortified.

Abbat Kederminster is thought to have rebuilt the
Cloisters.

Hem-y Boteler covered the Ohurch with lead, and was
buried in St. Nicholas Chapel, by the side of King Kenulph,
the Founder.

In 1892, when the first volume of the Landboo appeared,
Mra. Dent, the owner of Sudeley Castle, who had always
taken the deepest interest in the antiquities of Winchcomb
and the neighbourhood, determined to search for the
foundations of the Abbey, and entrusted the direction of
the work to Mr. Ε. P. Loftus Brock, F.S.A. The results
are given in a paper by that gentleman contributed to the
Journal of the British Archoeoloqical Aesooiation for 1893,
vol. xlix, pp. 163-172, with a ground plan. This paper
and plan were reprinted by Mrs. Dent in her Winokcombe
and Sudecey lisam-ds, pp. 242-257.

Mr. Brock found that the Conventual Church, and the
Cloieters and Conventual Buildings to the north of it,
lay to the east of the present. Parish Church in the grounds
of ΜΓ. smith, on the site marked in the. 25-ineh Ordnance
Map of 1884· as “ King Kenulph’e Palace’' and “the Remaine
of St. Mary's Abbey.’'

The foundations of the walls of the Nave and Transepts
were exposed, and also t’ne piere of the great. Central Tower.

On the site of the Tower Mrs. Dent. erected a handsothe
Celtic Oroete, with the following inscription :—

“This orons marks the centre of the Tower of the
Abbey Oburch‚ dedicated to St. Mary the virgin, and St.
Kenelm‚ AD. 789. >1⁴ The Dissolution of the Monastery,
Dec. 3, 1539, Involved the Destruction of the Church.
Here were buried King Kenulph, The Founder‚ and His
Son Kenelm‚ King and Martyr.”

Mr. Brock came to the conclusion that the so-called‘
Abbey Housee are part of the original Monastic Buildings.·
