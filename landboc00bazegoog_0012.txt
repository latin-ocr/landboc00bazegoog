ham, his cousin (now the Venerable Archdeaeon), followed
him a year later.¹ ’

As for Royce he entered Christ Church, Oxford„ in
1836, and was elected an Exhibitioner of Oakham in 1837.
1 know little of 1118 life at College, but no doubt he worked
steadily and won golden opinions as at School. He took
1118 degree· of B.A. (3rd 01888 Lit. hum.) in 1840 and was
ordained in the following year by Charles Richard Sumner,
Bishop of winchester, to the curacy of Winnal, Η81118,
taking Priest’s Orders in the following year. In 1843 he
became curate of St. Paul’n, Oxford.

Amongst the Governors of Oakham School at that
time appears the name of the Rev, Heneage·Finch, Vicar
of Oakham. Royce found in this clergyman a true and
constant friend3 and 1 believe it was through his influence
that he was in 1843 appointed Chaplain of Christ Church.
There are experts who claim the power of distinguishing
not only Oxonians from the alumni of the sister University
but the men of one College from those of another. Such
would have recognised in Mr. Royee's courteous and dignified
manner the best traditione of “ the House.” Together
with 1118 College appointment Mr. Royce held the curacy
of Cowley.

In 1850 he was presented by his College to the living
of Lower or Nether 811011, 81111 110 preached his first sermon
there on October 5th. In the following November he
married Elizabeth Ann, daughter of John Mould‚ Esq.‚
of Oundle.

In 1851 he commenced the erection of a Village 8011001,
81111 111 1852 8 new Nave was added to the Church. In
this good work he was largely and generously assisted by
ΜΓ. J oseph Sewell. Then followed 8 compilation by Mr.
Boyce of ’8 hymnal which was used at Nether Swell until
the introduction of Hymns Ancie‘nt and Modern in 1870.
