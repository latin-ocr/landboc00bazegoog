In 1861 he printed privately The History and Anti-
quities os Stow, and in 1874 a Histo‘ry os the Ohwrch of
Bmmon-on-the- Wate‘r.

At the Annual Summer Meeting of this Society, held
at Stow-on-the-Wold in 1881, he acted as Local Secretary
in conjunction with Mr. G. B. Witts,' and read the following
papers‚ which appear in the seventh volume of our Tram-
sactiom ε-ΤῘιε Ohurch of St. Mary, Nether Swell, Finds
‘near Stow-o‘n—the· wald, The N orthleach Gom-t Book, and
Icomb Place. Moreover, he acted as guido at several
of the interesting places which the Society visited. In
1891 the Society selected Moreton-in-Marsh for its Annual
Summer Meeffing, and Mr. Royce prepared a valuable paper
on Bourton-on-the—Hill, which appears in the sixteenth
volume of our immantatum.- Once again, in 1896, when
we met at Stow-on-the—Wold for ι the second time, Mr. Royce
described Icomb‚ his own Church at Nether Swell, and
the old Manor House of the Slaughters (see vol. xic).
In 1894 Mr. Royce was elected a Vice-President of this
Society. For an account of his interesting researches
amongst the barrows of his neighbourhood we must refer
to his paper on Fraude mentioned above, and to Rolleston
and Greenwell's Britieh Barrows. He made a collection
of flints, coins, and fossile, which are of great local value,
· and· as such Mrs. Royce has presented them, together with
nearly 150 books on such subjecte, to the Trustees of St.
Edward's Hall, Stow-on-the-Wold, to be held by them and
their successore for ever in his memory and for the use of
present and future studente

To the Bristol and Gloucestershire Archaeological
Society, Mrs. Royce generously gave all her husband‘s
books which he had used in his antiquarian researches‚
and his MS. notes relating to Winchcombe; and they have .

found a fitting home in the library of the Society at
Gloucester.¹
