believed to be right.”¹ To this valued testimony of. a follow
worker I would add my· own: during an acquaintance of
twenty years 1 found him a true friend, a modest, unassum-
ing but very cultured scholar and a typical clergyman and
gentleman of the best school.

It would be unfitting to conclude this Memoir without
a brief notice of his literary work, and his connection with
the North Oxfordshire and Bristol and Gloucestershire
Archaeological Societies. In 1853 the former Society was
founded with a view to the study of the antiquities in
North Oxfordshire and the establishment of a Museum at
Banbury. Mr. Royce’s name appears amongst the original
members. In 1853 he was placed on the Committee‚ and
in 1865 he was elected Local Secretary for East Gloucesterr
shire. In 1872 his name appears as General Secretary
together with the Rev. Philip Hookins and the Rev, W. D.
Macray. He contributed to the Society's Transactions,
om Accownt of Ghinnor, in 1874; a Histoi-3] os (ἕψεαι
Tew (md South Newi‘nyto‘n, in 1875; and Historical
Notices os the Pan-ish of Oropo-sely, Oaeo‘n, in 1880. He
also prepared many valuable notes on the history and
architecture of the places in his district which the Society
intended to visit. In 1890 his name appears as a Vice-
President.

Mr. Royce became a member of the Bristol and
Gloucestershire Archaeological Society at its foundation in
1876, and was elected a member of the Council in 1883.
It was often regretted that he was not more often present
at the Meetings of the Society and Council as, from his
intimate knowledge of the Cotteswold country around
Stow-on—the-Wold and his long and accurate study of ancient
lore, his help would have been invaluable3 but he shrank
more and more as years rolled by from leaving his home
and work even for a day.

Swell, appears in the Stmo Deam-y Maeotim, October, 1902.
