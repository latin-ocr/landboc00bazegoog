before the Bishop at his London House with a petition-
from the Convent for his Confirmation of their unanimous·
Decree or Decision.

Tenor of the Decree of Election 2-—

Prior Bryan and the Convent, as urged by the Canon
in case of vacancy, obtained the licence of the King‚ as
Patron and Advocato to elect. On Friday, Jan. 13, 1422,
they fixed J an. 15 and following dayS‚ stating and assigning-
what should be done. Then, immediately after the Mass of
the Holy Ghost at the High Altar, all the monks met,
saving one brother Chaddesley, absent on leave upon Con·-

Richard Wiche, Thomas Raggeleye, Richard Stanley, Thomas

Nor was there any discussion as to the form of election
by scrutiny or compromise, when, suddenly, ¹‘ without wine,’'
by the grace of the Holy Spirit, all carnal instigation at
rest, all votes are given, straightway, to John Cheltenham,
and his election approved of by all but himself. Te Deum
began, the bells rang merrily, and after repeated resistance,
he is brought into the Church to set him, as was wont,
upon the High Altar. Te Deum ended, and a befitting prayer
