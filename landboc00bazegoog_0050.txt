the inscription, “ Michale te pulsante Wynchelcumbam a
peterite demone Tu⁸ libera,” with supposed heads of
Edward III and Philippa3 on a shield, crowned, on a
saltoire a cross patee ‹Wincheomb); and, on either sides,
R. K. (Richard Kederminster, Abbat). Another bell, at

⁴ Stoneleigh is dedicated to St. Kenelm. It was recast in·

1⁷52, by T. Eyre, Kettering. The inscription on the original
bell was, ‘⁴ Ο Kenelme, Martyr Christi, nos defende, ne
maligni, sentiamnr feculas.”

An account of the disposal of the lands of the Abbey
would involve long research, and exceed the limits of this
introduction. The papers relating to the most important
manors are happily complete and admirably arranged by
the care and at the cost of the present Lord Sberborne.
The chief of these documents, given in extenso, with
facsimiles are published in a most valuable and sumptuous
work by this noble and munificent Peer, entitled, “ Memoirs
of the Duttons of Sherborne.’'

The lease of 1533 was made, possibly, under a fore-
casting of the coming dissolution, and signed by Abbat
Richard Mounslow‚ the Prior, and 23 monks (their names
above) to Sir John Alleyn,¹ twice Lord Mayor of London,
1525 and 1533, and giver of a mayoral gold chain, and a
man of great charity. Of the subsequent long, litigated
conveyance of Sherborne, this is the summat-y :- (l) The
lease of 1533 ; (2) Sir John Alleyn's removal, immediately
after the Dissolution of the Convent; (3) his will, dated
3 August, 15453 (4) 20 May, 1550, a decree of the Oourt of
Augmentation by Lord Sackville, Ohancellor, in favour of Sir
John’s executore, viz„ his brother christopher, Thomas Pike

¹ 1536. The Abbat on the King’s lease of the Frawntun pasturas to
Edmund conyngesby, his chamberlain, reminds Gromwell of their bargain
with Sir John Alleyn “for our ooles for years to come at a price certain
on pain of forfeiture of the lordship of Elim-borne, and that the selling
of the above pastui-es would interfere with the contract.” He begs the
King either to let them hold their pastures or to dissolve the bargain.
