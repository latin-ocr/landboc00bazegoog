AD VESPERAS. 'l'ribue Clemens et Misericors Deus in
beati testis Tui Kenelmi festivitate, fidelibus populis opem
salutis aeterne, nosque famulos Tuos per vigili custodi
protectione, ut qui Te Totis sensibus confitemur nulla
inimici fraude capiamur. Per . . . ‚²

Setting aeide different Masses with rubricated “ Coenelmi,”
p. 274, “ Konelmi,’' p. 280, Litanies in the Office of the
Dead prove, clearly, a book made for a Benedictine Ghureh,
and where SS. Peter and Oenelm had a particular cult.
Winchcomb Abbey was famous as the burial-place of St.
Cenelm, and the Church hard by was dedicated to St.
Peter.

Finally there is the relationship between Fleury and
Winchcomb. Oswald Bishop of Worcester and Archbishop
of York reconstructed the latter Monastery and confided
it to the Abbat Germain, about A.D. 985, and fetched him
from Fleury to be his fellow worker in its restoration.
The writing is of the school of the three Benedictionals
of St. Ethelwold, Archbishop Robert, and of Ramsay.
Little gold is used. The initials are mostly red, blue and
green, like to those of the Ramsay MS. The Sacramentary
of Winchcomb begins with a very large painted “D,’'
within which is an ·‘ S,” in the shape of “ 3’' reversed.

(ii.) In the preface to volume 1.. Landboc, a list (p. viii.‚‘n.)
is given of MS. containing the Life of St. Kenelm. Of
these, one is MS. Douce 368 [8, 79-82bJ.

And I have added: “A full account of the Douce MS.
and of its vicissitudes and various possessore—Thomas
Rawlinson, Lord Uola-aine, Philip Carteret Webb. Gustavus
Brander, and now (by the munificence of Francis Douce)
the Bodleian Library—will be given in the Memoir of
the Monastery in the second volume of this its Landboo.”

¹ At Vespere. Grant Ο God of elemenoy and meroy in the festivity

of Thy Blessed Witness Cenelm, to Thy faithful people saving and etex-nal
help; and keep us Thy servants under Thine ever watchful protection,
that we, who confess Thee with all our senses may not be taken captive

by any fraud of the enemy. Through . . . .
