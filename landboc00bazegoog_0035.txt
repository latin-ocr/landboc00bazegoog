1353.) The Abbey suffered no doubt from the great
mortality of the Black Death, but shortly afterwards it
was so far unable to support its eommunity and meet its
liabilities that a visitation of the Monastery was ordered
by the King. The Roll, referring probably to the discord
of this Abbat's reign, puts it thus 1-—“ By defect in past
administration, it is burdened with great deht, and its
state from various causes is so miserably impoverished,
that it is necessary to place the temporalities in the
hands of a commission appointed by the crown.’'¹
