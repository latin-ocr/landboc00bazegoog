of St. Paul ad Romanos, in which he says, “ non est potestas
nisi a Deo,”1 written on every monk’s forehead. ‘⁸ Thanks,”
he writes to Cromwell‚ “ for excusing my getting up for
Matius at Midnight. The truth ie, I do not like the
burdens religious such as their accustomed abstinence, the
frayter‚ and other observances of the Rule.” At any rate
the alms to the poor were duly administered, in memory

the Royal Patron, his son and succsssor, Cenelm, Saint '
and Martyr, did not escape. Thus piteously vanished from
the scene our “magnifical '' Mercian Monastery.
