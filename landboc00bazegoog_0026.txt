coarseness; for buskins they had high boots after the
monastic fashion. These and many other things we could
plainly discern even then though they had lain more than
300 years in the earth. From these and very many other
signs I am decidedly of opinion that monks at that time
in dress and food, and furthermore in character and manner
of life, were far more lowly, meek and sels-restrained than
we are in this unhappy age; and came much nearer to the
pure and simple observance of our rule as laid down in its
first institution hy our founder Benedict‚ from which, alas,
through the carelessness of our prelates, 'we seem nowadays
to have fallen away and utterly departed.

we may some day do away with those customs and privileges
which are contrary to our calling, and may embrace the
pure and honest observance of our sacred Rule without
false colour or pretence.’'¹
