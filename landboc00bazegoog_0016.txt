The work which occupied all Mr. Royce’s leieure 'heure
during the last twenty years of hie peaceful life· was -the
Landboc of Winchcombe Abbey.

' This valuable ’ cartulam-y was lost for many· year& and ”
it was fcared thet it had perished. ’ It will be told in· the
following peges how it was discovered in 187 7· end replaced
in the Muniment Room of Sherborne· House. Mr. Royce
‘asked the permission of its owner, Lord Sherborne, to
transcribe and print it by subscription, end to ‘this his

lordehip readily assented.
Mr. Royce commenced with Liber Β, the· earlier work

unaing from AD. 798 to A..D 1332, which he called
·Volu1ne Ι. This was iesued in 1892 with an Introduction
containing the History of the 'romi of Winchcombe. ·
·· ΜΓ. Boyce did not live to issue 'Liber A, Abbot
Chclt‘enham'e Register, compiled A.D. 1422, which-he called
Volumc Π ;· but he transcribed the whole of the original
text, epitomized it in English, and added copious notee.
All this he passed through >the prese, together with an Index'
to both· volumes, and the original List =of Charters. He
·spent several years in collecting material for an Introduction
relating to the History of the Abbey, the Lamdboc itself,

' and· some other MSS. known to have belonged to winch-

combe, but he died, ales, whilst the work was still incomplete.
No attempt hae been made to finish it: it were more fitting
that it should appear as he' left it, ‚though it is more, than
probable that errore will be found which wouldj have been
'avoided had he been, spared to inspect ‘ohe proofs. I have
to thank the Rev. O. S. Taylor, the Editor of this Socicty,
for kindly helping me to pass the Introduction through
the pressu and Mr. F. Gegg, of Evesham, for his permissioni
to reproduce the portreit of Mr. Roycc with the Landboc
. lying before him. - ⁴
