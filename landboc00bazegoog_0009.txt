Tun Ravaaann Dum Rovca was born at Oakham,
the capital of Rutland, on September 5th, 1817, and was
»educated at the ancient Grammar School of that town,
under Dr. Doncaster, a Schoolmaster of some renown.

There are few men who do not bear in middle life
the impress of their early surroundings. Mr. Royce's
birth—place is rich in the buildings and traditione of a
distant past. The Parish Church of All Saints where,
doubtless, David Royce was baptized, and received his
first 'impressione of religione truths, has passed through
many architectural changes and vicissitudes3 but the
general effect of what remains is symmetrical and har· '
monious. Mr. Royce was well able to read the archi-
tectural history of the past written in the walls, the
archeS, the mouldings, and the sculpture of our eccle-
siastical buildings. When, therefore, in later years, he
'revisited the scenes of his childhood he would delight in
following the marvellous transformatione which a series
of restorations had produced in Oakham Church. From
the latter part of the twelfth to the beginning of the
sixteenth every century witnessed some striking change,
until what at first had been a gloomy N orman Minster
with central tower and shallow aisles and transepts, had
become seemingly a creation of later times, light and
airy, and abounding in sculptured symbolic imagery.

The Hall, now used as a court of justice, standing
on the East of the Church, is the sole relic of a famous
-castle erected by Walchelin de Ferrars, Baron of ‘Oak ham,
in the reign of Henry ΙΙ. The internal walls are covered
with horse shoes of various shapes and' sizes, a custom
having prevailed for many centuries of compelling every
peer of the realm who passed through the town tc
