xlix.

On the remaining five leaves, in an Edwardian hand,
are the documents of various dates given in volume i., pp. 3-8.
On another set of five leaves, the earlier Index of the
thirteenth century scribe to deeds and matters arranged
according to their several contents, then collected and
bringing the “Landboc” into being. A δ (deest 2) denotes
missing charters supplied in vol. ii. On the other side
of leaf 5, left blank, has been entered a recognition of

service and a grant of land to the Abbey. See
volume i., p. 10.

On the first of two leaves here inserted is the purchase
of Dry Marston (1134) from william, Prior of Coventry,
for1,030 marks. See volume i., pp. 11-13. Then Knight
service from the Convent to the King from 16 hides, and

Scutage in aid of Edward Ι. See *volume i., pp. 13-15.

Then commences the Landboc proper, and naturally
leads off with the Foundation Chat-ter of Kenulph, King
of the Mercians. It concludes with decrees from Canon
and English Law, with the Benedictine Rule relating to
the Abbot and Prior, with the duties of the watchman as
prescribed in Ezekiel, chapS. xxxiii. and xxxiv.; the number
of Parish Churches, Vills, Knights’ Fece, and the amount of

tithes at 4d. in the mark, and Sequences‚ volume i.„
pp. 366-372.

Volume H. The second Register was compiled under the
direction of Abbot John Cheltinham‚ A.D. 1422. The pen-
manship is uniform‚ of a more massive character than that
of volume I. Here and there the scribe seems to be at fault,
and to paint a facsimile of some hopelessly illegible word.
The initials are in ink, tinted here and there, varied in form,
floriated and darting up and down the margin. There
are gossamer lines, graceful, exact and curving in the
finish. As we have shewn above the Register com-
mences on folio 1, with the election of the compilet, and

concludes on folio 509 with a grant to Henry, Rector of
staunton. ·
