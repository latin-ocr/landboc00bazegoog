liii.

The MS. is of the latter part of the twelfth century, very
clearly and beautifully written, in double columns. The
Life ends imperfect-ly, but there is not much wanting.
The volume was N ο. 399 in the sale catalogue of Thomas
Bawlinson’s MSS. in 1731, whence it was purchased by
Jamee West for 24. It is bound in Rawlinson's distinctive
style for binding MSS. which he specially valued, namely
in red russia, with the Rawlinson heraldic mussel—shells
at each corner, and the crest, a bird holding a twig in its
beak, in the centre3 and Rawlinson writes at the beginning,
‘⁸ Omnium quos vidi exemplarium Bedae si artem spectes
hoc est jure spectatissimum.” From West Philip Carteret
Webb, whose book-plata is inserted, must have obtained
it before West’s death, for the latter died in 17⁷2, and
Webb in 1770, but it does not appear in the sale catalogue
of his library in 1771. From him it passed to Gustavus
Brander, at whose sale in 1790, Douce notes that he bought
the book for only one guinea! Douce has inserted at the
end a note about the Bede made by Mr. Petrie in 1828.
The mention of Hugh flare, second Lord Coleraine, in the
above-quoted note as having been one of the ownerS, is a
mistake.
