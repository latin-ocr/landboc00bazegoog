In that year Mr. Sartoris, Lord of the Manor‚ rebuilt the ’
Chancel and enlarged the Churchyard. Notwithstanding
the thoroughness of these “ restorations ’² nothing was
destroyed of historic or architectural interest. The Norman
South Door and the Chaucel Arch of the same period
were allowed to remain intact‚ also the late Perpendicular
Porch, and the Font in which ΜΓ. Royce must have baptized
nearly two generations of his parishioners. All these and
many other relics of early times are described by ΜΓ. Royce
in his paper on “ St. Mary's Church, Nether Swell‚’' in the
seventh volume of the Trans-actions of the Bristol and
Gloucestmhire Archaeoloyical Society. In 1872, thanks
to the efforts of Mrs. Royce, a new organ was procured
for the Church, and in 1876 the School was enlarged to
meet the requirements of the Education Department. The
last addition to the Church was the Campanile with its
bells The venerable Bishop of Gloucester tells me that
on one occasion, when the important living of Cirencester
was vacant, he offered it to Mr. Royce, in appreciation of
his labours as a Parish Priest‚ but that he shrank from
accepting it, preferring the retirement of his own little
upland parish.¹ ⁸

Mr. Royce was always deeply interested in the Volunteer
movement‚ and the last occasion on which he was seen
in public was the Church Parade of the Stow-on-the—Wold
Company. He ministered in his beloved Church on Sunday,
August 3rd. On the morning of Coronation Day 116 was
so 111 68 to be unable to leave his bed. From that time
he gradually sank until on the 9th of September he
entered into rest. ·

“ Mr. Royce in 1118 dealings with his neighbours was
ever courteouS, kind and generous. His fine, genial presence
and the natural charm of his manner gained the love of
all with whom he came in contact. He was fearless in
reproving wrong and courageous in support of what 116
