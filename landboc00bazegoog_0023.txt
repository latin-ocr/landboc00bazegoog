course of the Severn in two parallel lines. The lowest
line formed by the Houses of worcester, founded A. D. 680;
Tewkesbury‚ Α.1). 705; Gloucester, A ..D 6803 the west line,
by Pei-shore, A.1›. 689, Evesham, Α..1) 7013 Winchcomb,
A.D. 789. All, 118 thinks, founded with a religious aim, and
possibly with a secondary, anti-celtic, strategical, missionary
and politica-1 purpose.

Some 150 years from its foundation, A..D 959, the House
was in the hands of Secular canons, and almost decayed.
St. Oswald, the great Bishop of worcester, with King
Edgar and such compeers as St. Dunstan, Archbishop of
Canterbury and Ethelwold, Bishop of Winchester set
himself on displacing the above less rigid clergy, and
converted the Secular Canons of Winchcomb into a com-
munity of MonkS. Armed likewise with the King's
authority the Bishop recovered any land lost to 1118
Monastery.

Re-dedication of the Church followed, still under the
tutelage of 1118 Β1888811 Mary, but with her now was
associated the Child-Saint Cenelm, canonized King 81111
Martyr. In the Survey it is, “the Church of St. Mary of
Winchcomb '’ only, possibly from the inspection of 1118
Earliest CharterS, or from the preeminence of the Blessed
Virgin as yet3 even as afterwards in the zenith of his fame

the patronage of St. Cenelm alone is recognized.
. A.D. 942, King Edgar presided over 8 Witenagemot,

probably in the Chapter 1101188.ι

An Abbey of course became celebrated before whose
High Altar reposed the bodies of the famous warrior and
founder King Cenulf, and of his child invested with a
sanctity,confi1med by the marvels wrought at his tomb.

The House is said to have fallen a prey to Dane and
Norman fury, though there is nothing in direct evidence
of the latter, beyond the deposition and imprisonment at
Gloucester (by W illiam) of the Saxon Abbat, Godric.
