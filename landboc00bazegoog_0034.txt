ing the disper-sion of the monks and ruin of the Abbey;

their nameS, which in timidity, yet in hope of Divine

assuage all rancour, strife and debate he ordained 2—(1) That
each gladly and humbly should kiss each other, which
joyfully and heartily they did. (2) The acceptance of the
resignation. (3) In consideration of the ex-Abbat’s humility
and well-ruled will in preferring the Convent's common weal
to his own interest and honour, with the Convent’s
unanimous consent, that the late Abbat, as a relic of
former dignity, should have the place in Choir and Chapter

of J ohn, Prior of Worcester; Thomas, Abbat of Hayles;
William, Prior of Llanthony; John de somery, Rector of
Twining3 and Walter de Sherborne‚ Rector of Stanton; in
trust3 and there he should live without let or disturbance;
and (5) he might visit the Abbey with a loving, special
welcome; have a goodly chamber for three or four days
at Convent charge3 if he stayed longer, at his own. For
the breach of this Covenant by the Convent, the penalty
shall be 2¹40 to the fabric (workshops 2) of worcester, and
for any disquietude or hindrance or pertu-rbation to the
said ex-Abbat, the greater excommunication. Lastly, on any
reported laxity or exeess (God forbid) on his part, the Abbat
and Convent might inflict rebuke and correction, but not the
withdrawal of their procuration. Winchcomb, Sept. 19, 1352.ι
