As a record of economy and property the Landboc
may be considered as the main survival of the Abbey; but
there are three other fine MS. known, which were executed
in its Cloister.

(i.) The Sacramentary now in the Library of Orleans.

(ii.) The Life of St. Kenelm in the Bodleian Library.
(iii.) The Annals of Winchcomb in the British Museum.

(i.) An acquaintance with this precious relic sprang
from the wide information and courteous readiness to com-
municate it on the part of ΜΓ. Falconer Madau, Sub·
Librarian of the Bodleian. The discovery however of its true
character and history, in' the first place, is to be ascribed

to the. keen insight and close examination of M. Leopold
Delisle, chief Librarian of the Bibliotheque Nationale at

Paris.¹ The latter assigns the volume to the eleventh ·

century. It was gathered into the Library of the city
of Orleans with the debris of the Monastery of Fleury-sur-
Loire, where it is now, number-ed MS. 105. It contains
182 leaves of parchment, measuring 10} in. by 8⁴} in. It
consiste of six parts. 1. The Canon of the Mass (imper-
,fect). 2. Prayers and Prefaces Proper according to the
time, beginning with Christmas. 3. The Proper Prayers
and Services for Saints DayS, beginning with St. Etienne.
4. Of the “Commune Sanctorum.'' 5 Prayers for divers
Messes and IntentionS. 6. Different CeremonieS, Masses
or PrayerS, especially the Portions (les morceaux), entitled
‘⁸ Incipit ordo ungendi infirmum.’' Masses for the sick unto
death3 for St. Sigismund; and for the sick with sever, and

‘⁸ Incipiunt ” orationes in agenda mortuorum—the office of
the dead.
