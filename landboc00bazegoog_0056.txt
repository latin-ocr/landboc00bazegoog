pagos. The pagination is of two kinds 2—(1). The leaves
only are numbered from the earliest of the two indexes to
leaf 120, with the exception of pages 101-113, where there
is a gap or leap. Edwardian entries here introduced seem
to be continuous. (2). After page 120 the pages are
numbered consecutively as in this printed copy.

The earliest penmanship 'is that of the refined scribe
of the thirteenth century. The inlr, after seven centur-ies
of atmospheric and other trying agencies, is now like
ebony in bulk, brilliance, and blackness

A faint cruciform framing, and fine, slightly incised
line8‚ and marginal piercingS, shape and regulata the earliest
text. On removing the composition that had fixed the
once first limp cover to the oaken binding, out gleamed
the primal title Lamdboc. On the inner side of this
supposed original cover, the thirteenth century scribe begins
loyally with a list of Anglo-Saxon and Norman Kings,
from Ethelwulfl (the honoured guest of Pope Leo IV, and
the Patron of Monasteries and Churches) to John. This
schedule seems to betray the bias of the House. King
Edward the confessor is ‘⁸ Sanctus frater,” Harold is
‘⁶ comes,” William “ bastardus? Stephon (a friend and a
fighter for the House and Town) is “ miles fortissimus,'’
and John “ Santerre.'’ Henry the Third has been added
later, and without comment. See vol. i., p. 2.

There are two Indexes. A second and later one, arranging
the deeds as they come, is placed first, occupying the first
three of eight leaves, seemingly inserted, and too much
effaced and stained to be printed. So blank is the first
page as for the aforesaid Exhibit to be written here, trans-
uersely. Across the remaining space runs the playful
jingle :—

“ Omnibus est notum quod multum diligo potum

Omnibus et mys mas quod multum diligo dryf draf
Omnibus et ryf raff ............
