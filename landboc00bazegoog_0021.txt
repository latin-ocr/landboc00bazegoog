INTRODUOTION.

Ι Ι. ΤΗΕ MONASTERY.

A Nunnery is said to have been founded in Winchcomb
by offa, King of Mercia, A.D. 787. Cynethrith,¹ daughter
of King Cenolf, is entitled Abbess of Winchcomb. A.D. 825,
with Abbess Aelflaed as her successor. This establishment
may have ceased on the foundation of the Mona-stery by
Cenulf after Eadbert Pren’s suppression and the annexabion
of Κοοι ιο the Mercian Kingdom. The King, “religious
at home '' as well as victorious in war, determined ιο build
a Monastery on a large scale at his royal resideam,
Winchcomb. The foundation was laid two years after the
Kentish campaign, A.D. 796—811. The Abbey was dedicated
with great promp ιο the Blessed Vir-gin Mary by Wulfrid,
Archbishop of Ormiza-bury,² in the presence of two Kings,
Sired‚ King of East AngHa, and Cuthred (Cenulf's deputy)
of Kent, thirteen bishop8‚ ten ealdormen. and an immense
concourse. Gifts were showered on all according ιο
their rank οι· need3 ιο kingS, prelateS, and ealdormcn,
homae, silken garmentS, and precious vessels; ιο each
noble without land a pound weight of gold; ιο every
priest. a mancus of gold (about 25s.); and ιο every
monk and cleric a proportionatae sum. The crowxiing gift,
of tho day was freedom ιο the mutilated and tonsured
usurpet of Kent⁸ from the hand of Uenulf at the High
Alter, before all.

¹ Annales de Winchcomb, Οοιι. MSS. Lingard thinks that Cynethrith
may be so called, because her father left her the Abbey.
