twenties, when the reign of George 1v was drawing to a
close, that he first came under the iron rule of Dr. Doncaster;
and 110 remained under it till 1836. These were the halcyon
days ’of the School‘s existence. Τ110 great modern schools
of Cheltenham, Marlborough, Clifton, and Malvern were
still unborn, and Uppingham had not yet come under the
magio influence of Thring. High up in the Mathematical
and Classical Triposes at Cambridge appeared the names
of studente trained at Uppingham‚ Oakham, Repton, and
Stamford, far more in proportion to the number of studente
than from any school at the present day.

When Royce became a pupil Dr. Doncaster had been
ruling at Oakham some twenty years and he was yet to
control its destinies for another eighteen years. That he
was an able teacher and a polished classical scholar all who
came under his influence are agreed, but he was severe
and lacking in sympathy with those he taught. When
Dr. Doncaster resigned, in 1846, the Governors were lavish
in their praise of his work, and in their congratulatione
on his many academical successes.

Let the names of some of Royce’s companions bear
witness to the Doctor's genius. No less than seven won
“ Bell '’ Scholarships at Cambridge: Arrowsmith in 1833,
Attlay (afterwards Fellow of St. John's and Bishop of
Hereford) and Liddendale Smith in 1837, Clarles J. Ellicott
(the present distinguished Bishop of Gloucester) and Thomas
Robinson in 1838, Thomas Field in 1841, and Edward John
Selwyn in 1843. But only the sons of clergymen could
win these scholarships3 Stevenson, an Exhibitioner of
Oakham in 1831, was third Wrangler‚ and Percival Frost,
who died only a short time age, was second Wrangler‚
first Smith's Prizeman and Fellow of St. J ohn's.

Bishop Ellicott tells me that some part of the credit
for these successes is due to the Rev. F. E. Gretton,
son of a Dean of Hereford, who was Usher, or Second
Master of Oakham, and was promoted to be Head Master
of Stamford School in 1833. Thither Ellicott and Shering-
