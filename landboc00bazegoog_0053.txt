ΙΙΙ. THE LANDBOC.

This early ‚English name, described on the original
thirteenth century parchment cover of the earliest Register
is extended to the later one of the fifteenth century in
this reproduction of them both by the Press.

This MS. is much set by for two reasons3 it is the
main relic of one of the oldest Benedictine Houses; and
there were serious misgivings as to its loss. For its
joyous recovery untold gratitudo is due, directly, to E. C.
Sewell, Esq„ of Oirencester, into whose hands the missing
MS. providentially had fallen, under the following cir-
cumstances 2·—

At the suppression of St. Kenelm's Monastery, the manor
of Sherborne, the most important of its possessione, was
confirmed to Sir John Alleyn, twice Mayor of London.
Christopher, his son and heir, passed it to a distinguished
member of the House of Dutton‚ Thomas Dutton, Esq„
surveyor for the County of Gloucester, and ancestor of
the Noble House, and of the present Right Honourable
Lord Sherborne. The Landboc went with Sherborne, and
was safely lodged in Sherborne House until the close of
the eighteenth century. A tithe suit then arose² which
brought the Lcmdboo into prominence as establishing a
legal precedent as to the adrnissibility of a book in private
custody as evidence in court.²

This fact is gleaned from the following original

letter :—
Gnu’s Iun,

30 July, 1808.
